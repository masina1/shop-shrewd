## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + React Router + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Data Processing**: Client-side normalization pipeline for vendor feeds
- **Search**: Diacritics-insensitive search with faceted filtering
- **I18n**: Romanian/English language support
- **Development**: ESLint + Prettier + Husky for code quality

## Features

- üõí **Multi-store price comparison** across 5 major Romanian retailers
- üîç **Smart search** with diacritics-insensitive matching
- üì± **Mobile-responsive** design with touch-friendly interface
- üè∑Ô∏è **Advanced filtering** by category, brand, store, price range, promotions
- üí∞ **Cheapest price detection** with alternative offers
- üìã **Wishlists and combos** with local storage persistence

## Data Architecture

The application uses a sophisticated normalization pipeline to unify data from different vendors:

- **Canonical product IDs**: EAN/GTIN preferred, fallback to normalized brand+name+size
- **Category mapping**: Unified two-level taxonomy across all stores
- **Quality flags**: Detection of missing prices, images, unit mismatches
- **Synonym handling**: Intelligent matching for fat content, processing methods, sizes

## Development Data

Sample vendor data is available in `public/data/dev/` for:

- Auchan
- Carrefour
- Kaufland
- Mega Image
- Freshful
