## 📋 Immediate Action Items (Updated - This Week)

### ✅ **Current System Status**

**Working Components:**

- ✅ Preprocessing pipeline with Freshful + Universal fallback normalizers
- ✅ Generated output data in `/out/{shop}-final/` (Auchan, Carrefour, Freshful, Lidl, Mega)
- ✅ Complete admin panel at `/ori-core/*` with 14 functional pages
- ✅ Search indices generation working with FlexSearch
- ✅ Category sharding and JSONL output structure

### 🎯 **Next Priority Tasks**

1. **Connect Real Data to Admin Panel**

   ```powershell
   # Current: Admin panel uses mock data
   # TODO: Connect to preprocessed data in /out/{shop}-final/
   ```

2. **Enhance Shop-Specific Normalizers**

   ```powershell
   cd shop-shrewd/preprocessor
   # Add dedicated normalizers for each shop (currently using fallback)
   # Test with real shop data patterns
   ```

3. **Integration Testing**

   ```powershell
   # Test admin panel with real preprocessed data
   # Validate search indices with actual products
   # Performance testing with large datasets
   ```

### For Administrators

1. **Environment Setup**

   - Follow [Installation Guide](./INSTALLATION.md)
   - Configure environment variables
   - Test CLI commands

2. **Data Preparation**

   - Organize shop data files by directory
   - Ensure consistent JSON format
   - Create backup procedures

3. **Category Review**
   - Review canonical category structure
   - Identify shop-specific mappings needed
   - Document business rules for categories

## 🔍 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

```powershell
# Test individual components
cd preprocessor
pnpm test

# Test specific normalizers
pnpm test --grep "Freshful"

# Test category mapping
pnpm test --grep "CategoryMapping"
```

### Integration Testing

```powershell
# Test with small datasets
pnpm preprocess freshful --limit 100 --verbose

# Test all shops with samples
pnpm preprocess all --limit 50 --dry-run

# Performance testing
pnpm preprocess freshful --limit 10000 --perf
```

### Production Testing

```powershell
# Large dataset processing
pnpm preprocess freshful --report --verbose

# Memory stress testing
